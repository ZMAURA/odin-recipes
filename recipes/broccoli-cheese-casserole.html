    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>My mom made this broccoli cheese casserole every Thanksgiving when I was little. We kids could never get enough! If you have children or have some coming to visit you as guests this Thanksgiving.</p>
    <p>I guarantee that they will eat (and enjoy) this veggie dish. It's also fabulous with a Christmas ham.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>3 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped broccoli</li>
        <li>8 ounces shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 dash paprika</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F</li>
        <li>Whisk condensed soup, mayonnaise, egg, and onions together in a medium mixing bowl until combined.</li>
